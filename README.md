## Complete Tutorial: From IOCs to Production BITS Deployment

This comprehensive tutorial takes beamline scientists from understanding their EPICS IOCs to creating a fully functional BITS deployment with their own GitHub repository.

### Tutorial Overview

**Target Audience**: Beamline scientists with EPICS IOCs who want to implement Bluesky data acquisition

**Prerequisites**:
- Running EPICS IOCs (we provide containerized examples)
- Basic Python knowledge
- Git/GitHub familiarity
- Linux/macOS environment

**Time Commitment**: ~2-3 hours for complete tutorial

**End Result**: Production-ready BITS deployment in your own GitHub repository

cd bits_demo/scripts
./start_demo_iocs.sh

# 2. Explore your IOCs
python explore_iocs.py

# 3. Follow the tutorial step by step
# Start with tutorial/00_introduction.md
```

### What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

1. **Working Instrument Package**: Complete BITS deployment controlling your IOCs
2. **GitHub Repository**: Professional deployment repository with documentation
3. **Custom Scan Plans**: Tailored to your experimental needs
4. **Data Analysis Tools**: Jupyter notebooks and visualization setup
5. **Remote Capabilities**: Queue server for unattended operation
6. **Validation Framework**: Tools to verify system functionality

### Support & Troubleshooting

- **Scripts**: Automated validation and troubleshooting tools in `scripts/`
- **Examples**: Working examples for all concepts in `examples/`
- **Templates**: Ready-to-use templates in `templates/`
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides in `tutorial/`

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section in each tutorial step
2. Run validation scripts in `scripts/`
3. Compare with working examples in `examples/`
4. Review the FAQ in the final verification step

### Container IOCs Provided

This tutorial includes two containerized IOCs for learning:

- **adsim IOC** (`adsim:`): Area Detector simulation with 2D detector
- **gp IOC** (`gp:`): General purpose IOC with 20 motors, 3 scalers, and support records

These provide a realistic learning environment without requiring physical hardware.

### Next Steps

After completing this tutorial:
- Adapt the examples to your actual hardware
- Customize scan plans for your science requirements  
- Deploy to your beamline environment
- Share with your team through GitHub
- Extend with additional devices and capabilities
